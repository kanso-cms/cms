 * The plugins.php file allows you to customize Kanso's behavior right from instantiation. 
 * Because the functions.php is only loaded once Kanso has dispatched a request, the plugins.php 
 * file is used to manipulate Kanso. This also helps keep Kanso Themes more modular as you 
 * are able to separate a Theme's dependencies and any customizations to Kanso.
